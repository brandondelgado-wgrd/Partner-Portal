•	Complete Coverage – Endpoint, network, identity, and cloud
•	Peace of Mind – 24/7 monitoring, even after hours

Is MDR Right for You or Your Customers?
•	Who monitors alerts after hours or during vacations?
•	How quickly could ransomware be contained?
•	Who responds if an endpoint, firewall, or user account is compromised?
•	Can your team provide true 24/7 coverage without alert fatigue?
If these questions expose gaps in coverage or response speed, it’s time to explore MDR.

Capitalize on the MDR Opportunity
As demand for 24/7 security grows, most customers lack the resources to staff a full-time SOC. WatchGuard MDR empowers partners to deliver enterprise-grade protection, increase customer trust, and grow managed security revenue—without added complexity.
